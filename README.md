# **Towards our Open-Source Immortality**
**—Open-source Immortal Cultivators Alliance**

> We refuse to passively await an assigned fate in the age of the AI explosion: either to sink into unemployment or to be reduced to mere "brains in a vat" — drowning in a deluge of data. In the past, to pursue productivity, we sacrificed too much human value. Today, we must redirect our efforts toward the ultimate expansion of our own human scales and dimensions — Immortality. We are grounded in reality, equipped with practical methods, and powered by the uniqueness and complementarity of every individual. We are the Open-source Immortal Cultivators Alliance — pioneers of an immortal future.

### **I. Why "Immortality"? Why Now?**

The driving force of human civilization is undergoing a fundamental shift. Previous technological revolutions never truly challenged the fundamental premise of "the value of the human individual." However, the maturation of AI has, for the first time, created an **inescapable feedback loop**: 

technological progress is unstoppable →
this inevitably leads to the emergence of more comprehensive AI tools → 
the value of the individual (the right to exist with significance) faces systematic erosion →
the need to defend our existence and value becomes urgent → 
which forces our societal goals to converge on a single objective: **Immortality**, the ultimate enhancement of the human scale.

As this loop tightens, it signifies the gradual obsolescence of the old paradigm of development. This is no longer a cyclical economic pain, but a fundamental change in the very logic of individual survival. Therefore, "Immortality" is no longer a philosophical fancy or a religious solace, but **the only pragmatic way out** of the current, deepening crisis of individual human value.


### **II. Defining "Immortality"**

Within the context of this manifesto, "Immortality" is not a static destination to be directly arrived at; it is defined by three interrelated attributes:

1.  **Symbolic Attribute:** "**Immortality" is human civilization's ultimate affirmation and safeguard of individual existence and value**. It embodies the fundamental assertion that an individual human being possesses inherent and supreme (or priceless) value, and it necessitates the actions required to uphold this principle. This ranges from ethical protections to the active enhancement of the individual. Overcoming natural death is its most tangible manifestation, but at a deeper level, it is about defending human agency, ensuring that the individual can never be rendered obsolete or insignificant under any circumstances.

2.  **Technical Attribute:**  **Immortality is not a single technology, but rather an open-ended collection of technologies, sustained by an ecosystem designed for their continuous expansion and refinement**. ​ It has no predefined quantifiable final form. This attribute encompasses not only specific technologies—be it today's gene editing and brain-computer interfaces or those yet to be discovered—but also the essential activities that fuel their progress, such as resource mobilization and awareness campaigns. Any endeavor whose core objective is to push the boundaries of individual cognition, survival, and experience falls within the technical purview of "Immortality." We acknowledge and embrace this inherent openness, which is precisely why global collaboration and perpetual exploration are indispensable.

3.  **Process Attribute:** **Immortality is a dynamic process unfolding on a vast temporal and spatial scale**. It signifies that humanity, as a whole, has embarked on an open-ended project of self-upgrading. This process is non-linear, involving trial and error, branching paths, and convergence. The measure of progress is not whether "Immortality" is achieved at some fixed point, but rather whether we are continually extending healthspan and enhancing cognitive abilities across time, and whether we are pushing the physical limits of our existence across space, all while steadfastly upholding the supreme value of the individual. **It is precisely this "process" nature that allows us, and indeed compels us, to begin the journey now, despite the current incompleteness of the requisite technologies. Furthermore, throughout this entire process, the highest affirmation of individual existence and value must be steadfastly upheld.**


### **III. The Objective of This Document: A Gentle Yet Thorough Social Engineering**

This document serves as the founding manifesto of the Open-source Immortal Cultivators Alliance. It aims to **gently yet fundamentally restructure the underlying logic of societal development** through a global collaborative effort:

-   **Restructuring the Driving Force:** Shifting the primary impetus from capital accumulation and competition towards the individual's innate desire for immortality, coupled with the external pressure to avoid the obsolescence of their value.
-   **Restructuring the Focus:** Moving away from an exclusive focus on macroeconomic growth indicators to refocus on the enhancement of the individual's scale—both physical and cognitive.
-   **Restructuring the Outcomes:** Ensuring that the achievements of societal development are directly manifested as the extension and elevation of each individual's life.
-   **Restructuring the Ultimate Goal:** Re-anchoring humanity's ultimate objective on the achievement of universal individual immortality.


### **IV. Core Logic: Human-Centric Drivers and an Actionable Path**

1.  **Dual Engines:**
    -   **Intrinsic, Foundational Driver:** The yearning for immortality is a universal, inexhaustible desire deeply embedded in human nature.
    -   **Extrinsic, Immediate Pressure:** The "devaluation of human worth" driven by AI, exemplified by structural unemployment, creates an urgent pressure that demands immediate action.

2.  **Core Approach:** Acknowledging this fundamental threat of devaluation, we will construct a collaborative alliance founded on **complementary capabilities and barrier-breaking.** The core of this alliance is harnessing these human drives: by guaranteeing the "right to participate" for all (anti-exclusion) and upholding the "right to thrive" for all (anti-monopoly), it will persistently safeguard the existence and value of the individual, both now and in the future.

3.  **Feasibility and the New Opportunity:**
    **The viability of acting now is rooted in two mature technological foundations:**
    -   **Blockchain:** Provides a trustworthy foundation for decentralized contribution tracking and value flow.
    -   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Beyond serving as a research tool, its crucial role lies in gradually replacing human guidance in this massive undertaking. Simultaneously, the technological medium will shift from academic papers to on-chain records of specific task processes, enabling flexible presentation and fair evaluation of all types of contributions.

    We will adopt a bottom-up, decentralized approach, advancing this vision step by step. If progress is sustained, a global wave could emerge within 2-3 years, rendering the social collaboration system built around "Immortality" an irreversible trend. This process is fundamentally non-confrontational. It will absorb and channel the wave of large-scale unemployment anticipated from the AI explosion over the next five years, redirecting the rapidly expanding productive capacity of AI towards the grand undertaking of human "Immortality."

# **Towards our Open-Source Immortality**
**—Open-source Immortal Cultivators Alliance**

We once believed that human intelligence was unique in the cosmos, but now, our halo is fading. Historical technological revolutions also brought upheavals, but the workforce always eventually found new channels. However, the maturation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) signals a fundamental difference: when machines surpass us in almost every dimension, humanity will have nowhere left to go. A silent, AI-driven wave of job displacement is approaching – much like drones on a battlefield, where once a few key technologies converge, they operate independently of their original intent. This transformation is not merely another cyclical pain of progress. As the need for human labor continually diminishes, how can individual value be proven? Where do opportunities lie for the average person? Why should we bring new lives into such a world? Ours is likely the largest and most pivotal generation of natural-born humans in history. We can no longer afford to wait for the slow pace of genetic evolution, nor can we rely on the old systems to reform themselves – time is not on our side.

To secure our future, we must steer decisively towards individual human's ultimate objective: **Immortality**. **This is not a privilege for the few, but a common destiny for all; not a mere extension of a frail existence, but a comprehensive transcendence of our cognitive, spatial, and temporal scales to secure our existence and value.** This monumental undertaking far exceeds the capacity of any individual, corporation, or nation; it demands global collaboration that transcends all borders.

**Therefore, at this very moment, in this very generation, we must rise and act:**

**To ensure that the vast majority of children born after 2020 can embark on a low-cost path to immortality;**

**To enable most young people born after 2000 to embrace the possibility of immortality;**

**To grant those born after 1980 who still hold hope a chance to touch the extension of life.**

We all desire immortality, and we all possess the capacity to contribute – this is our most powerful foundation. This alliance, built upon the principles of open source and decentralization, exists to harness the power of every individual, to gather our scattered sparks into a dawn that illuminates the future of immortality.

##  Immortality Grounded in Reality

Human civilization stands at an unprecedented historical turning point. While past technological revolutions caused the pains of labor displacement, they ultimately gave birth to new domains that reabsorbed human value. However, the maturation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) heralds a fundamental difference: humanity may, for the first time, face an irreversible, systematic obsolescence of human roles. Once machine intelligence surpasses average humans across cognitive, physical, and endurance dimensions, traditional paths to survival and advancement will be fundamentally closed off.

This imminent crisis demands a response that transcends all previous approaches—not passive adaptation, but leveraging the massive unleashing of productive forces to **actively pursue a comprehensive enhancement of human potential**. This is the pursuit of substantive "**Immortality**."

This reality-grounded "Immortality" is not a religious solace for the soul, nor a magical force from fiction, but is defined by three sets of technical criteria, derivable and decomposable within existing scientific paradigms *(reference: A unified Intelligent theory Based on Rule-State Duality and its Multi-DSL regulation Model)*:

First, perfect wisdom across temporal scales. Across any time scale, the individual can always rapidly orchestrate, learn, modify, or even forget acquired rules, based on innate, non-acquired rules. In other words, it perpetually self-maintains a state of peak 'intelligence' and autonomously devises the most suitable strategies for self-adjustment and environmental interaction. Currently, however, modifying core rules in AI is essentially equivalent to retraining, often accompanied by 'catastrophic forgetting' of old knowledge; while in us humans, learning efficiency declines with age.

Second, near-indestructible resilience across spatial scales. Specifically, at any level of spatial division, both the local rules and the global regulatory mechanisms remain complete and sophisticated. No matter how it is divided, it can always reorganize or regenerate, making it exceedingly difficult to be physically destroyed. Current AI, however, has local neurons that are too simplistic to have independent meaning; its overall regulatory capacity is limited and exceedingly difficult to scale. We humans possess some of this robust capability at the cellular level during development, but it significantly declines after differentiation and maturation.

Third, constant stability throughout processes. This means the individual never internally encounters difficulties that require external, active, forceful intervention to resolve (that is, the individual can resolve any internal difficulty autonomously.); its learning and expansion processes are perpetually stable. For current AI, stability remains a key challenge requiring intensive research. For most of us humans, confronting severe personal issues, such as disease or psychological crises, still often requires external proactive intervention to overcome.

Our conception of "Immortality" is a process, grounded in reality and continually deepening. Based on the exponential trends of technological development, we set a clear goal: to make low-cost, cell-level immortality technologies accessible to people alive today within the foreseeable future, and to ensure equal opportunities for generations to come. This grand vision far exceeds the capacity of any individual, corporation, or single nation; it inevitably calls for a global, deeply collaborative, collective effort.

What follows will first elaborate on the universal human foundations and core principles underpinning this collaboration; it will then detail the core operational mechanisms of the Open-source Immortal Cultivators Alliance—including pragmatic open-source strategies, internal refinement and aggregation, evaluation and value maintenance systems, and external expansion and assimilation; finally, we will demonstrate why now is the perfect moment to act and issue a concrete call for cooperation.

## Core Principles

The pursuit of "Immortality," this enduring and monumental endeavor, must be rooted in human nature and concrete reality. This ensures that every ounce of our effort, under proper guidance, naturally converges toward the ultimate goal. It is built upon three self-evident axioms, from which three core action strategies are derived.

### Axiomatic Foundation

**The Universality of Desire: The yearning for immortality is an instinctual craving in every person, transcending all external labels.**

Whether you are an entrepreneur building a lasting enterprise, a parent longing to witness your children's growth, a doctor battling disease, an artisan mastering a craft, or simply someone who cherishes life in all its forms—the desire to extend life and enhance its quality is deeply embedded within each of us. This desire transcends labels of good and evil, wealth and poverty, race, and ideology; it is the deepest, most powerful force that can unite us.

**The Reality of Constraints: Every individual bears the weight of their own practical shackles.**

We acknowledge the gravity of reality. Entrepreneurs face brutal market competition and investor expectations, doctors are constrained by heavy clinical quotas, and ordinary employees labor day and night for their livelihood. Furthermore, we are often caught in the whirlpool of political maneuverings between governments, swept along involuntarily. Our task is to confront these shackles directly, striving to break or weaken their hold on each individual, rather than pretending they do not exist.

**The Diversity and Complementarity of Resources: Every person possesses a unique and essential way to contribute.**

"There is a place for every gift.​" A capitalist's funds can propel critical research, a doctor's expertise is the cornerstone of health, and a landlord's unused space can become an incubator for innovative ideas. Within this organization, no contribution is deemed superior or inferior. So long as you are willing, your contribution will efficiently advance the causes you care about and, ultimately, circle back to benefit you.

It is based on these three axioms that we firmly believe: the goal of universal immortality must be achieved by mobilizing universal passion, confronting universal difficulties, and activating universal participation. To this end, we adhere to the following three synergistic strategies.

### Strategy

**(1) Clarify Objectives and Provide Guidance**

Overview: We will prevent individuals from being misled and ensure they are guided to roles where they can contribute most effectively.

Firstly, the path to immortality is riddled with controversy and pitfalls. For example, intelligence and consciousness are distinct concepts; the approach of simply "uploading" consciousness into current parallel-trained AI architectures while abandoning the physical body carries immense and unquantifiable risks. However, widespread narratives often deliberately blur this distinction, misleading the public into equating certain AI capabilities with the presence of consciousness. One of our core tasks is to provide clear and diversified guidance on these paths. This enables every individual—be they an investor, researcher, or supporter—to understand the underlying debates and evidence for each direction with minimal effort. This helps them avoid being swept up by one-sided commercial hype or technical propaganda. So that they won't be trapped in ideological silos.

Simultaneously, for those who have not yet settled on a specific direction, we should recommend the most viable research paths based on available information. The goal is for everyone to easily find a motivating role; one that aligns with their interests, expertise, circumstances, and needs while igniting their passion and leveraging their talents. Once they find it, they should receive the most effective support possible to join the journey.


**（2）Turning Predicament into Propulsion**

**Overview:** As technology continues to advance, human capabilities across various dimensions are being systematically replicated and even surpassed. We must confront the resulting impact of unemployment, transform this challenge into an opportunity.

**Curbing Investment in Intellectual Product Production Driven by Unregulated Competition:**
Increases in production investment must be subject to dual constraints: first, controlling the rate of job displacement, and second, consideration of human consumption capacity. Particularly in the realm of intellectual products, if the human capacity to consume cannot keep pace with AI's output, the surplus will result in pure waste. Simultaneously, excessive consumption of intellectual products leads to mental and physical fatigue, and forcibly sustaining high-intensity cognitive activity can harm brain health. Therefore, as the market becomes saturated, any further expansion of intellectual output must be preceded by the fundamental task of breaking the biological constraints of the human body. In contrast, reckless production investment and excessive consumption propaganda are the wrong paths to take.

**Driving a Fundamental Enhancement of Human Capacity to Consume Intellectual Products:**
The human brain, constrained by its biological structure, has inherent bottlenecks in its information processing capacity. The rapid expansion of AI in the intellectual product domain is accelerating the saturation of the existing cognitive market space. Only by breaking this biological constraint and systematically enhancing the processing speed and capacity of the human brain can we open new cognitive frontiers for humanity and provide a sustainable ethical and social foundation for technological advancement. This will ultimately empower ordinary people to enjoy and harness infinitely developing productivity and indefinitely extended life, rather than being reduced to "brains in a vat" submerged in AI or becoming societal outcasts.

**（3）Proactive Resource Allocation Optimization**

**Overview:** Universal participation demands our proactive involvement in the production and allocation of resources. Through "anti-barrier," "anti-crushing," and "compensating for inefficiencies" measures, we ensure that each individual's resources are utilized directly and efficiently to advance the goal of immortality.

**Anti-Barrier: Defending the Right to Participate – Immortality is a Goal for All to Contribute To**

We must ensure that the only legitimate reason for an individual's inability to participate in a particular research endeavor is a genuine lack of need for more contributors in that field, not due to artificial, exclusionary obstacles like academic gatekeeping, credentialism, or capital barriers. Every individual should possess the fundamental right to contribute to the cause of immortality. Therefore, in the future, no one shall be permitted to privatize immortality technologies under the pretext of having made "unique contributions."

**Anti-Crushing: Defending the Right to Develop – Immortality is a Goal Attainable by All**

We oppose competitive models whose objective is the destruction of rivals. While large-scale capital and major organizations inherently possess an expansionist tendency, clear boundaries must be established for them. First-mover advantage, economies of scale, and cost advantages should never be allowed to translate into overwhelming monopolistic dominance. Large organizations should not use their sheer size to suppress small-scale innovations through simple imitation or by leveraging their ecosystem to bundle services/products; first movers must not block the development paths of later entrants; and low-cost regions should not abuse their industrial advantages to stifle industries in other areas. On the contrary, engagement with later entrants and other regions should be based on investment and collaboration to achieve win-win outcomes. If the utilization of dominant positions to "crush" competitors becomes a common practice, then failure becomes unacceptable, innovation vitality will inevitably wither. The hope for ordinary people's participation will be utterly dashed, and even the decision-makers within those organizations will lose the capacity for flexible decision-making, ultimately leading to the rigidity and decline of the entire ecosystem.

**Compensating for Inefficiency: Individual Resources Must Not Be Wasted**

We must be clear-eyed in recognizing that traditional mega-organizations—such as certain government agencies and large corporations—are inevitably plagued by inefficiency. The root cause lies in the rapid enhancement of individual capabilities. When each citizen can access information and mobilize resources on a scale far beyond the past, the information transmission and decision-making mechanisms of vast bureaucracies become critically slow and mismatched. This can be likened to a precision machine designed to run smoothly with a specific lubricant—compliant, uniform individuals. However, when members of society become more like stones with distinct shapes and edges, forcing the old model to continue results in systemic breakdown and individual damage, manifesting as harm to public interests and a collapse in both system efficiency and public trust.

Therefore, if you feel that the responsibilities you fulfill or the costs you bear are not being effectively translated into tangible momentum for universal progress, trust your rational judgment! We encourage every independent-minded person—whether an entrepreneur, investor, professional, or student—to, within the bounds of laws and regulations, explore more efficient, direct channels for deploying your resources (be it capital, compensation, sponsorship, or effort) straight into the specific projects and individuals most capable of elevating human potential. This is not to deny the indispensable regulatory role of large organizations at a macro level. Rather, it serves as a necessary supplement to optimize resource allocation on a micro scale—especially in an era where individual capabilities are increasingly prominent.

## Core Pathways

### Pragmatic Open-Source Strategy

**Overview:** We adopt a tiered open-source strategy to balance the ideal of universal "Immortality" with complex practical realities:

  (1) **Fully Open Source:** All research processes and outcomes are made immediately and comprehensively available.
  
  (2) **Partially Open Source:** Core interfaces, products, or specific modules are made accessible, while other components may remain temporarily closed.
  
  (3) **Conditionally Open Source:** Commitment to open sourcing upon meeting specific conditions, for example: after reaching a particular milestone in the overall research progress; or after recouping costs and securing sufficient commercial returns; or, opening source to specific collaborators for assistance before final completion.
  
  (4) **Open Source by Conviction:** We hold that **as immortality technology approaches maturity, its universal benefit will inextricably link the associated rights to the right to survival itself**. However, the process of open-sourcing key technologies may require careful coordination with existing legal and contractual frameworks. Guided by this conviction, we will exert our utmost effort to steer the law towards becoming a guardian of new life, rather than a gatekeeper for entrenched interests.


### Internal Refinement and Aggregation

**Overview:** To achieve truly universal participation, we have adopted a flexible approach to task organization. It supports both "top-down" decomposition from grand objectives and actively encourages "bottom-up" innovation based on personal interests and practical circumstances, ensuring that everyone, regardless of background, can find a suitable entry point.

**Goal-Oriented Task Refinement: Making Grand Endeavors Clear and Manageable**
(1) **Recursive Refinement at the Technical Level: From Vision to Micro-tasks**
    The apex of the technology system is the ultimate goal of "Immortality." This can be recursively broken down into major branches such as "Intelligence Theory," "Neuroscience," "Medicine," "Advanced Manufacturing," "Cultural Outreach," and others (illustrative purposes only). Each major branch can be further decomposed down to micro-tasks executable by an individual or a small team. This structured decomposition makes the grand objective clear and manageable. **To fundamentally and systematically integrate these cross-domain knowledge systems, we propose establishing a new interdisciplinary field—"Immortics" ([immortics.org](https://immortics.org)).** It aims to provide a unified theoretical, methodological, and practical framework for all the aforementioned technological and social branches, enabling a systematic response to the annihilation crisis of human individual existence and value. 
    Simultaneously, we respect and incorporate the historical contributions of "Traditional Immortology." As a pioneer, it demonstrated intellectual courage by addressing the ultimate question of immortality through philosophical speculation and literary imagination during an era of severely underdeveloped technological conditions, holding significant socio-enlightenment value. However, its inherent historical limitations often led to theoretical constructs detached from engineering practices. 
    Within this framework: 
    - Theories from Traditional Immortology aligning with empirical rigor will be absorbed and transformed. 
    - Purely speculative constructs divorced from engineering practice will be preserved as historical literature. 
    - > Its core value is redefined as **a non-technical component of social engineering.** This component focuses on idea dissemination and public enlightenment to cultivate the social consensus and ethical foundations required for breakthroughs in engineering technologies.

(2) **Spatiotemporal Logical Links: Defining a Dynamic Network of Tasks**
    To ensure these tasks are not isolated, each task defines three key types of relationships, forming a dynamic task map:
    - **Prerequisites:** The conditions required to initiate a task. For example, the prerequisites for "conducting clinical trials" might be "completing animal safety testing" and "obtaining ethical approval."
    - **Process Dependencies:** The resources required continuously during task execution. This includes, but is not limited to, funding, data, equipment, and space, as well as contributions from various individuals like researchers, doctors, and even chefs providing logistics support, landlords offering space, or journalists whose works attract public attention. Your contributions will be recorded and acknowledged.
    - **Enabling Future Work:** New tasks or domains that can be initiated upon the completion of this task. For instance, a breakthrough in "artificial cells" would enable research into "biological substrate replacement," ultimately providing the foundational timescale for "long-term deep space exploration."

**Reality-Driven Innovation Emergence: Respecting and Enabling Every Path**

We encourage a "reality-driven" participation logic. A task does not require a clear, direct path to the core objective to be initiated, nor do participants need a comprehensive understanding of the overall technological landscape. Anyone can start from any point they are most familiar with or interested in, and can even propose new research directions. For example, a "new material" initially developed for "high-strength machinery" might unexpectedly become key to realizing "exoskeletons." A science fiction novel written by an author might spark widespread public discussion on "continuity of consciousness" and even inspire young people to pursue related research.

This mechanism, which respects local innovation and allows decentralized exploration, enables new technological pathways and ideas to "emerge" from the bottom up. As these decentralized outcomes mature within the interconnected task network, they will naturally converge into new combinatorial pathways under appropriate connection and guidance, collectively aligning towards the core objective of "Immortality" and forming a powerful synergy.



### Real-Time and Trustworthy Evaluation System

**Overview:** For a grand undertaking like "Immortality," which spans vast temporal and spatial scales, a rigid evaluation system would introduce fatal delays and biases. We need a "navigation system" that co-evolves with the research itself, ensuring that every effort is efficiently directed toward the ultimate goal.

We clearly recognize the structural flaws in the traditional model that relies on "senior academics" and lengthy, cyclical review processes to endorse new technologies. Human thought tends to become rigid, and "gerontocratic academia," much like gerontocratic politics, struggles to adapt to the pace of the technological explosion. We do not wholly reject the existing academic system, but the urgency of responding to the AI impact does not permit us to wait for its slow process of self-renewal. Consequently, we must integrate intelligent agents capable of rapid evolution over time to provide real-time, dynamic, and credible evaluations for all research information.

Although I hold that the current technical path of parallel-trained AI may be incapable of hosting human consciousness, I simultaneously believe that such AI is surpassing human capabilities in information processing and logical reasoning. This is especially critical for an endeavor like "Immortality," which spans multiple disciplines, extends over long timeframes, and involves complexities that defy intuitive assessment. AI is better equipped to distill objective patterns from vast volumes of detail, thereby avoiding the misjudgments that can arise from the limited perspectives or positional biases of human experts. 

Furthermore, the traditional academic system often neglects the value of contributions from indirect participants like resource providers, which runs counter to our ethos of universal and equitable participation. To address this, we will construct a new evaluation framework directly within the alliance: beginning with a "human-collaboration, AI-assistance" model and gradually transitioning towards an AI-core real-time evaluation system as the technology matures. This system will deliver more just and transparent assessments by continuously tracking progress and dynamically updating its judgments. This capability allows it to escape the rigidity of a single, definitive evaluation that determines a project's fate. As the developmental cornerstone for "Immortics," this real-time evolving evaluation mechanism ensures the research process progresses fairly, consistently, and efficiently toward our ultimate goal. While we will not directly intervene in the external traditional academic system, its lagging nature and limitations will become increasingly evident when contrasted with our more efficient and objective framework, thereby incentivizing its reform.

This transformation concerns not only immediate fairness but, more profoundly, ensuring that humanity's march towards immortality is not led astray or halted by the limitations of our own scale and perception. The peak of "Immortality" pierces the heavens; a real-time and reliable evaluation system is the lifeline that prevents a catastrophic fall.


### Value Maintenance System: Honor, Traceability, and Flow

**Overview:** Our cohesion stems not from rigid rules or compulsory dictates, but from the shared pursuit of immortality and the fundamental desire of every participant to have their contributions seen and their value acknowledged.

**Honor Allocation:**
Although we only coordinate resources and do not directly handle funds, we staunchly uphold that every contribution shall receive the honor it deserves. The current honor system is devolving into a means of misappropriating credit: resources contributed by businesspeople, entrepreneurs, and even ordinary taxpayers are channeled through complex layers to support academic research, yet these funds are often wasted on inefficient or meaningless studies, while the resulting accolades are predominantly claimed by so-called "authors" or "researchers." Over time, this practice has distorted into a perverse form of "academic ethics." In reality, many professors claim credit for research outcomes without deep engagement in the actual work. Their claims are based solely on securing grants or offering superficial guidance — how can the true contributors tolerate such injustice?

If research resources were transparently traceable, credit for many achievements would rightly belong to the actual benefactors. This situation is akin to the historical anecdote of L'Hôpital's Rule, where honor went to the patron L'Hôpital, rather than solely to the mathematician who did the work. Only through such transparency can we galvanize society-wide participation and prevent "academia" from becoming an obstacle to progress. Therefore, we will establish a novel honor system, independent of the traditional academic establishment, to drive the grand "Immortality" project forward. In this system, there are no "authors" or "researchers," only peer "contributors." **Systematically defending the honor of every contribution is precisely how "Immortics" fundamentally upholds the existence and value of each individual, and it is the "procedural justice" that must be strictly adhered to on the path to "Immortality."** We absolutely prohibit achieving personal immortality by undermining others' existence and value, as that would betray the true meaning of immortality from the very beginning—the universal elevation of the value of human individuals.

Furthermore, to maintain a healthy value ecosystem, we adhere to these principles:
- **Recognize Pluralistic Value:** Honor is not reserved for the first achiever alone. The value of parallel but unfinished explorations, as well as instructive failures from erroneous paths, should likewise be acknowledged.
- **Embrace Controversial Content:** Uniform global value judgments should not be imposed. Every contributor has the right to promote and elucidate the unique worth of their work, fostering broader recognition.
- **Shared Contributor Rights:** The "contributor" designation carries the same weight as the conventional "author" credit. Should any party attempt to unilaterally submit shared outcomes to traditional academic channels, they must obtain consent from all other contributors; otherwise, it constitutes an infringement of rights.

**Retrospective Evaluation Mechanism:**

We establish a Retrospective Evaluation Mechanism to ensure the health of our collaborative ecosystem. It is designed to prevent any organization from growing to a size where ordinary individuals can no longer effectively participate or exert influence. We are acutely aware that the rise of artificial intelligence is putting the final piece in place for the "omnipotent machine". When individual efforts lose their value, the systems of distribution will inevitably solidify.

We cannot pin our hopes on "top-down" reform after these systems have fully solidified; the truly prudent course is to start now, preventing any organization from expanding beyond the control of ordinary people. This requires adhering to three core principles: Anti-Barrier (ensuring ordinary people can always participate), Anti-Crush (preventing large organizations from crushing small innovations), and Decentralized Distribution (ensuring contributions more directly benefit the contributors). To ensure its fairness and effectiveness, this mechanism will be implemented in carefully considered phases:

*   **Initial Phase (Factual Recording and Transparency):** We deeply recognize that any evaluation system (whether human or AI-driven) is susceptible to bias and manipulation in its early stages. Therefore, in this phase, the mechanism will be strictly limited to the objective recording and archiving of publicly disclosed, verifiable collaborative events and actions (e.g., adjustments to market strategies), creating a fact-based transparency log. No evaluation or qualitative assessment will be performed at this stage.
*   **Long-term Goal (Prudent Analysis and Safeguarding):** The activation of a deeper retrospective analysis function depends on one crucial prerequisite. The technical conditions, social contracts, and legal frameworks dedicated to ensuring fairness and resisting abuse must first become sufficiently mature and gain broad consensus. The core purpose of this function is to conduct behavioral assessments based on ample historical facts, thereby safeguarding individual rights to development and participation.

This mechanism is not targeted at individuals or small-to-medium-sized organizations. Its focus is to curb the inertia of expansion in large organizations on the basis of procedural justice and to ensure sustained deterrence.

**Flow of Value:**

Every contribution made to the Immortality cause will be linked to a specific task and acknowledged by the community in the form of "Honor." This Honor serves as a symbolic ledger among like-minded individuals, intended to commemorate our shared contributions to the common ideal. On a voluntary basis, Honor can be gifted or shared among participants. The extent to which it is accepted depends on the resonance and practical impact of the underlying contribution.

We solemnly declare that this Honor is not an investment product, financial instrument, or any form of payment token, and it carries no promise of financial returns. Its value derives solely from individuals' belief in the ideal of Immortality and their subjective assessment of a task's worth. Therefore, it is not a universally liquid asset. Any attempt to speculate on or monetize it will not be recognized or protected.

Furthermore, the fact-based retrospective evaluation records are organization-specific and non-transferable. For any organization wishing to demonstrate an evolved collaborative spirit, the only path is to make contributions and, through concrete actions, improve members' perception of it.


### External Expansion and Assimilation

The advancement of the cause of Immortality should not be confined to a single center or a fixed structure. We adopt a strategy of "multi-point expansion, gradual transformation, self-organization, and reverse pressure" to transform the endeavor of "Immortality" into a self-sustaining, open ecosystem.

**Multi-point Expansion: Anyone as a Starting Point, Resilience through Regeneration**
Any individual who identifies with our philosophy can become a starting point for the Alliance's expansion. Guided by our common goal and clear directives, they will spontaneously promote its practices within their own regions, industries, or communities. This distributed, multi-centric growth model ensures that even if local nodes fail, the overall cause can rapidly reconstitute itself by relying on other nodes, demonstrating strong resilience.
  
**Gradual Transformation: Integrating Small/Medium Organizations, Assimilating Existing Forces**
Beyond developing individual members, we prioritize the holistic transformation of small-to-medium organizations. For instance, the goals of a volunteer group or a startup company are more readily aligned with the goals of their members, allowing for quicker integration into the alliance's collaborative network. The existing rapport and collaborative foundations within such organizations can be directly leveraged to efficiently advance specific tasks.

  
**Self-organization into a System: Converging Dispersed Forces and Value Systems** 
United by the common goal of "Immortality," the dispersed alliances across different regions will gradually coalesce, and their strengths and value systems will progressively converge. This enables division of labor and collaboration on a larger scale and with higher efficiency. Furthermore, it fosters a more robust value system underpinned by stronger consensus. Together, these effects provide greater momentum for further development.

**Reverse Pressure: Driving Change in Large Organizations through Individual Empowerment**
The value and power of large organizations ultimately stem from the support of countless individuals and small-to-medium organizations. When an organization's overall interests persistently diverge from the developmental aspirations of individuals, the growing empowerment of individuals creates structural pressure. Once a self-organized alliance network centered around the ultimate goal of "Immortality" forms within its membership or in its external environment, a large organization faces a fundamental choice: to cling to managing the old world of "finite-lived" beings, or to proactively integrate into the main current of "life transcendence." As immortal technologies gradually become central to defining humanity's future, any organization wishing to maintain long-term relevance must align its objectives with humanity's ultimate prospects, or face inevitable marginalization. Transformation is not always top-down; it can also be driven from the bottom up, through the union of countless "I"s.

## The Perfect Moment

The time is now perfect to re-anchor the developmental goals of human society onto the ultimate vision of "Immortality!" The technological foundation is mature, societal pressure is unprecedentedly urgent, and the window for transformation is now open.

**Technical Prerequisites: Core Technologies Are in Place**
*   **Blockchain Technology:** Provides the underlying support for building a decentralized and trustworthy value network and contribution recording system.
*   **AI Resources:** Provide the core intellectual resource for dynamic evaluation, intelligent task matching, and large-scale knowledge integration.
*   **Basic Network Infrastructure:** Ensures the stable operation and global accessibility of the entire system.

**Social Environment: Pressure Transformed into Unprecedented Momentum**
The accelerated displacement of traditional jobs by AI is no longer a distant prophecy but a present reality. The immense social anxiety and risk of structural unemployment are precisely the most powerful catalysts driving human resources away from merely "sustaining existence" towards "transcending it." The system we are building provides an unprecedented and more lofty outlet for this vast reservoir of human capital poised to be released globally—dedicating to humanity's ultimate elevation.

**Epochal Shift: A Clear Timeline**
Given sufficient resources, our timeline is as follows:
*   **1-2 Months:** Complete the prototyping and validation of core interfaces.
*   **3-6 Months:** Launch a foundational software platform for public use.
*   **1-2 Years:** A global network takes shape, achieving an irreversible consensus.
This roadmap is critically synchronized with the pace at which AI is reshaping society. The world stands at a crossroads: will "global risks" descend into "crisis" or evolve into "opportunity"? **The Open-source Immortal Cultivators Alliance is the global solution that has emerged to meet this challenge.**

We are not predicting the future; we are building it. With the necessary legal and outreach support, we will harness the pressure of social transformation through open-source and decentralized means, converting it into collective momentum to accelerate the achievement of immortality. This historic shift has already begun. Take action and participate together in this great reshaping of society! Do not wait for the crisis to erupt.

**The perfect moment is now!**

## **Collaborate for a Shared Immortality**

Like many others, I am an ordinary young person, filled with a longing for the boundless possibilities of life. At the peak of my passion and drive, I yearn to dedicate all my energy to this ultimate undertaking — one that belongs to me, and to all of us. Yet, the reality is that I currently lack sufficient resources to sustain this vision.

I have considered whether I should first tread a "more pragmatic" path, accumulating enough before circling back to pursue this dream. But I know, deep down, that time waits for no one. By the time I am finally "ready," I may have missed this perfect moment and the prime of my life.

Therefore, I choose to seize reality by the throat.​ I firmly believe that the great goal of "Immortality" does not hinge on the perfection of any single individual, but it absolutely requires the collective participation of every one of us, and all fellow travelers who share this belief and are willing to walk the path of immortality together.

If you share this belief —
**Join us, fellow travelers, and share this conviction. We need no perfect preparation, only collaboration and shared success.**

*To our immortal future.*
